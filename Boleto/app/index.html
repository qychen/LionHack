<h3> <center> A Little About Me </center> </h3>

<p> </p><p>I am a current resident of the great City of New York! I work in the field of data science; a field highly focused on empirical research. I am currently pursuing my second master's in Data Science at Columbia University. I completed my first graduate degree at Clemson University in Economics and Statistics in 2011 and my undergraduate degree in Economics at Illinois State University in 2010. My specialties are in machine learning, econometrics, and statistics.

<p>I was born of immigrant parents from Mexico. I, myself, am a natural-born citizen of the United States. I am an elementary school graduate of the Chicago Public School system and a high school graduate of Marian Catholic High School. </p>

<p>I am a 26 year old Chicagoan, born on the South-East side of the city. I'm a White Sox baseball fan. I love statistical theory, economic theory, and their product (i.e., econometric theory). I spend much of my time reading, writing, playing guitar, singing songs, watching the occasional movie, exercising, and spending time with my family.</p>
